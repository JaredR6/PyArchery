# PyArchery

My old 2016 project.
Files untouched except for old graded files.
I have no idea why the models don't have their own folder.

## Legacy Instructions

This project requires the following libraries to be installed via pip:
pygame
numpy
PyOpenGL
PyOpenGL_accelerate

The project also requires another library to be installed with special instructions.

1. Install pyassimp via pip
2. Move "assimp-vc140-mt.dll" to the directory pyassimp was installed in. This is usually <PythonInstallation>/Lib/site-packages/pyassimp/

The project should be able to run smoothly.
